# Interview Questions and Answers for LogicLens Interview Prep Portal

This document covers potential interview questions that can arise from the development and architecture of the LogicLens project. Each answer includes the reasoning behind technology choices and practices, demonstrating strong design principles and real-world application knowledge.

## 1. **Why did you choose Angular over React or Vue?**

### Answer:

Angular offers a robust, opinionated framework with built-in features like dependency injection, routing, and form validation, which speeds up large-scale application development. It is ideal for structured applications like the LogicLens Portal where consistency, modularity, and testability are key.

### Justification:

* CLI tooling simplifies scaffolding and builds.
* Component-based architecture helps modularize visualizer routes.
* TypeScript support improves developer productivity and reduces bugs.
* Angular's powerful router allows lazy loading and guard implementation for scalability.

## 2. **Why did you use Spring Boot for the backend?**

### Answer:

Spring Boot enables rapid development of REST APIs with minimal configuration. It integrates seamlessly with databases, supports validation, exception handling, and has a large ecosystem of libraries.

### Justification:

* RESTful design follows standard best practices.
* Easy to containerize using Docker.
* Spring Data simplifies DB operations.
* Security can be added later with Spring Security if needed.

---

## 3. **What database did you use and why?**

### Answer:

A document-based database like MongoDB was selected for flexibility in storing problems, solutions, test cases, and metadata.

### Justification:

* Problems have variable content (examples, explanations, etc.).
* JSON structure maps well with MongoDB documents.
* Free tiers available on Atlas for quick deployments.

Alternatively, PostgreSQL can be used if relational structure is preferred.

## 4. **Why did you choose Docker for deployment?**

### Answer:

Docker provides environment consistency across development and deployment. It also enables easy testing of microservice-style components (frontend, backend, database).

### Justification:

* Containerized builds reduce dependency issues.
* docker-compose simplifies multi-container orchestration.
* Suitable for CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 5. **How did you design for scalability and responsiveness?**

### Answer:

Responsiveness is handled using TailwindCSS (or Angular Material). The layout uses grid/flexbox and media queries to adapt to various devices.

### Justification:

* Tailwind allows rapid styling using utility classes.
* Mobile-first design ensures accessibility across screen sizes.
* Lazy loading of routes/components ensures performance.

---

## 6. **What makes this project interview-worthy?**

### Answer:

The project demonstrates full-stack capabilities, covering:

* Frontend: Angular SPA with animations and routing
* Backend: Spring Boot APIs with exception handling and RESTful structure
* DevOps: Docker-based setup
* Database: Integration with NoSQL/SQL
* Documentation: .md files for each problem, solution, and explanation
* Visualization: HTML/Angular based problem visualizers

### Bonus:

* The project includes advanced DSA solutions.
* Prepares for technical interviews through visualization and structured problem breakdowns.

---

## 7. **How did you organize and manage problems in the repository?**

### Answer:

Each problem is organized under topics like arrays, strings, graphs, etc., with a dedicated folder structure. It includes:

* Problem.md
* Solution.md
* Java implementation
* Unit tests
* Visualizer HTML/Angular component

### Justification:

This promotes maintainability and makes it easy to add, update, or visualize problems individually.

---

## 8. **What are potential improvements or extensions to the portal?**

### Answer:

* Add user authentication and bookmarking features.
* Enable discussion/comments on problems.
* Add code editor + online compiler.
* CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions.

These ideas show future scalability and feature planning.

---

## 9. **How did you ensure the code quality?**

### Answer:

* Used JUnit for backend test coverage.
* Linting and formatting with Prettier/ESLint for Angular.
* Code structured into small, testable components/services.
