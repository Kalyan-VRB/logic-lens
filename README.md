# LogicLens

**LogicLens** is a structured repository for solving and documenting computer science problems. It is designed to help developers, students, and interviewees organize their learning while building a solid foundation in problem-solving using Java.

This project not only focuses on writing efficient code but also on understanding the approach behind each solution, validating with test cases, and maintaining clean documentation for each problem.

---

## What You’ll Find in This Repository

- Java-based solutions to a wide range of algorithmic and data structure problems
- JUnit test cases to verify correctness and handle edge cases
- Markdown files explaining:
  - The problem statement
  - The chosen approach and reasoning
  - Time and space complexity analysis
- Python utility scripts to auto-generate boilerplate files and directories
- Well-organized folder structure categorized by problem types (e.g., arrays, strings, dp, graphs)

---

## Purpose of the Project

- Build a structured and maintainable archive of problems and solutions
- Reinforce understanding by documenting each step of the problem-solving process
- Serve as a personal prep vault for coding interviews
- Encourage clean, readable, and testable Java code

## Directory Structure
logiclens/
├── arrays/
│   ├── ProblemName.java
│   ├── ProblemNameTest.java
│   ├── ProblemName.md
│   └── ProblemNameSolution.md

Each directory corresponds to a category of problems and contains:

- Java implementation of the problem
- JUnit tests
- Markdown files for documentation

---

## Getting Started

To explore:

1. Browse through the category folders.
2. Open any problem directory.
3. Review the `ProblemName.md` for the question.
4. Read `ProblemNameSolution.md` for the approach and complexity.
5. Review `ProblemName.java` and `ProblemNameTest.java` for implementation and test coverage.

## Tools & Technologies

- Java (for implementations)
- JUnit (for testing)
- Markdown (for documentation)
- Python (for file generation utilities)
- Maven (for build and test automation, optional)
